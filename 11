The issue arises because in shell scripting, when you assign multiple options to a variable, they are treated as a single string. When you pass this variable to a command, the entire string is treated as a single argument, rather than separate options.

To fix this, you need to use an array in your shell script to store multiple options. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Solution: Use an Array for SSH_OPTS

#!/bin/bash

# Define the SSH options in an array
SSH_OPTS=(-o IdentityFile=./rsa -o Port=2323)

# Run sftp with the options
sftp "${SSH_OPTS[@]}" abc@server.com

Explanation:
	1.	Array Definition: The SSH_OPTS variable is defined as an array where each option is a separate element.
	2.	Pass Options to Command: Using "${SSH_OPTS[@]}" ensures each element in the array is passed as a separate argument to the sftp command.

This approach works because Bash properly expands the array into separate arguments when passed to a command.

Alternative: Using eval (Not Recommended)

If you must use a plain string, you can use eval (though it is not recommended due to potential security risks):

#!/bin/bash

# Define SSH options as a string
SSH_OPTS="-o IdentityFile=./rsa -o Port=2323"

# Run the sftp command with eval
eval "sftp $SSH_OPTS abc@server.com"

However, this method is prone to security issues if the variable contains user input, so the array-based approach is safer and more robust.
